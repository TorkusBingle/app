Group3Project: Migrant fatality

Hello! And welcome to our application

Running the application is easy and can be accomplished in a few short steps

First, you need to download a zip of the file from github. This will contain the IPYNB file containing the application, and the necessary CSV files required.

After downloading the zip extract it to your computer

After extraction, upload the notebook and CSV files to your IDE of choice

Run the notebook and at the bottom output there will be a URL you can enter into your browser which will lead you to the app.

If you are running the application in deepnote (the IDE we utilized) you can also go to "show enviornment details" in the bottom left of the page. Directly below "incoming connections" there is a tunneling link that will also direct you to the app when 

copied into your browser.
